## About

This project is created to help me in understanding how to implement TDD in iOS projects. <br />

This project PRs are reviewed by [Christian Slanzi](https://github.com/ChristianSlanzi). <br />

[Christian Slanzi](https://github.com/ChristianSlanzi) is teaching iOS developers on many topics. One of the topic is TDD in iOS Development. Following his teachings I have created this project to re-collect the things explained in the learning session.
